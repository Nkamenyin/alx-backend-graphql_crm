Crons: Scheduling and Automating Tasks
 
Overview
Cron is a time-based task scheduler in Unix-like systems, commonly used to automate repetitive jobs like backups, notifications, and system maintenance. In the context of Django applications, task scheduling can be integrated at multiple levels — from basic system cron jobs executing Django management commands to advanced asynchronous scheduling with tools like Celery and django-celery-beat.

This module explores the various methods of scheduling and automating tasks in Django. Learners will gain hands-on experience using system crontabs, django-cron, and Celery to implement reliable and maintainable background processes.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

Explain what cron jobs are and their role in task automation.
Write and schedule cron jobs using the system crontab.
Implement recurring tasks using django-cron in Django projects.
Configure and use Celery for asynchronous and periodic task scheduling.
Understand the strengths and limitations of each approach.
Apply best practices for debugging and managing automated tasks.

Learning Outcomes
After completing this lesson, learners should be able to:

Schedule and manage cron jobs using crontab.
Create custom Django management commands for scheduled tasks.
Use django-cron to define and run cron jobs within the Django ecosystem.
Set up Celery with django-celery-beat for scalable, distributed task scheduling.
Monitor, debug, and secure scheduled processes in production.

Key Concepts
Concept	Description
Crontab Syntax	-- Defines when a command should be run, using 5 time fields and a command.
System Cron + Django -- Uses native system scheduling to run Django commands on a schedule.
django-cron	A library to define scheduled jobs inside Django apps.
Celery & Celery Beat -- An asynchronous task queue with support for periodic execution.
Log Management	-- Redirection of task output to logs for easier monitoring and debugging.

Best Practices for Using Crons in Django
Area -- Best Practice
Scheduling	-- Use absolute paths in cron jobs to avoid environment-related issues.
Debugging	-- Redirect output (>> /log/path.log 2>&1) to capture logs for each job.
Frequency	-- Avoid frequent jobs that can strain the system; batch where possible.
Access Control	-- Use cron.allow and cron.deny for user-level access restrictions.
Celery Tasks	-- Keep them idempotent to prevent errors on retries.
Monitoring	-- Use admin dashboards or custom alerts for task failures in production.

Tasks
0. Task 0: Schedule a Customer Cleanup Script
Objective
Set up a GraphQL endpoint and define your first schema and query.

Instructions
1. Create a Shell Script: * Create a shell script clean_inactive_customers.sh in the crm/cron_jobs directory. * The script should:

Use Django’s manage.py shell to execute a Python command that deletes customers with no orders since a year ago.
Log the number of deleted customers to a /tmp/customer_cleanup_log.txt with a timestamp.
Include a shebang (#!/bin/bash) and ensure the script is executable (chmod +x).
2. Create a Crontab Entry:

Create a filecrm/cron_jobs/customer_cleanup_crontab.txt with a single line specifying the cron job to run the script every Sunday at 2:00 AM.
Ensure no extra newlines in the file.
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-graphql_crm
File: clean_inactive_customers.sh, customer_cleanup_crontab.txt

1. Schedule a GraphQL-Based Order Reminder Script
Objective
Create a Python script that uses a GraphQL query to find pending orders (order_date within the last week) and logs reminders, scheduled to run daily using a cron job.

Instructions
Create a Python Script:
Create send_order_reminders.py in crm/cron_jobs.
The script should:
Use the gql library to query the GraphQL endpoint (http://localhost:8000/graphql) for orders with order_date within the last 7 days.
Log each order’s ID and customer email to /tmp/order_reminders_log.txt with a timestamp.
Print "Order reminders processed!"to the console.

Create a Crontab Entry:
Create crm/cron_jobs/order_reminders_crontab.txt with a single line to run the script daily at 8:00 AM.
Ensure no extra newlines.

Repo:
GitHub repository: alx-backend-graphql_crm
File: send_order_reminders.py, order_reminders_crontab.txt

2. Heartbeat Logger with django-crontab
Objective
Implement a django-crontab job that logs a heartbeat message every 5 minutes to confirm the CRM application’s health, integrating with the GraphQL schema.

Instructions
Install django-crontab:
Add django-crontab to requirements.txt.
Add django_crontab to INSTALLED_APPS incrm/settings.py.
Define the Cron Job:
In crm/cron.py, define a function log_crm_heartbeat that:
Logs a message in the formatDD/MM/YYYY-HH:MM:SS CRM is alive to/tmp/crm_heartbeat_log.txt.
Appends to the file (does not overwrite).

Optionally, queries the GraphQL hello field to verify the endpoint is responsive.

Configure the Cron Job:
In crm/settings.py, add to CRONJOBS:

CRONJOBS = [
    ('*/5 * * * *', 'crm.cron.log_crm_heartbeat'),
]

Repo:
GitHub repository: alx-backend-graphql_crm
File: crm/cron.py, crm/settings.py, requirements.txt

3. Schedule a GraphQL Mutation for Product Stock Alerts
Objective
Create a django-crontab job that runs every 12 hours, uses a GraphQL mutation to update low-stock products (stock < 10), and logs the updates.

Instructions
Define a GraphQL Mutation:
In crm/schema.py, add a UpdateLowStockProducts mutation that:

Queries products with stock < 10.
Increments their stock by 10 (simulating restocking).
Returns a list of updated products and a success message.
Create a Cron Job:
In crm/cron.py, define update_low_stock that:

Executes the UpdateLowStockProducts mutation via the GraphQL endpoint.
Logs updated product names and new stock levels to /tmp/low_stock_updates_log.txt with a timestamp.
In crm/settings.py, add to CRONJOBS:


CRONJOBS = [
    ('0 */12 * * *', 'crm.cron.update_low_stock'),
]
Repo:
GitHub repository: alx-backend-graphql_crm
File: crm/schema.py, crm/cron.py, crm/settings.py

4. Celery Task for Generating CRM Reports
Optional
Objective
Configure a Celery task with Celery Beat to generate a weekly CRM report (summarizing total orders, customers, and revenue) and log it, integrating with the GraphQL schema.

Instructions:
1. Set Up Celery:

Add celery and django-celery-beat to requirements.txt.
Add django_celery_beat to INSTALLED_APPS in crm/settings.py.
Create crm/celery.py to initialize the Celery app with Redis as the broker (redis://localhost:6379/0).
Update crm/__init__.py to load the Celery app.
2. Define the Celery Task:

In crm/tasks.py, define a task generate_crm_report that:
Uses a GraphQL query to fetch: * Total number of customers. * Total number of orders. * Total revenue (sum of totalamount from orders).
Logs the report to/tmp/crm_report_log.txt with a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - Report: X customers, Y orders, Z revenue.
3. Schedule with Celery Beat:

In crm/settings.py, configure:
CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    'generate-crm-report': {
        'task': 'crm.tasks.generate_crm_report',
        'schedule': crontab(day_of_week='mon', hour=6, minute=0),
    },
}
4. Document Setup:

Create crm/README.md with steps to:

InstallRedis and dependencies.
Run migrations (python manage.py migrate).
Start Celery worker (celery -A crm worker -l info).
Start Celery Beat (celery -A crm beat -l info).
Verify logs in /tmp/crm_report_log.txt.
